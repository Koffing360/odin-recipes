    <h2> I KNOW THIS IS A BIG PICTURE !</h2>
    <h3> But we have more important things to discuss</h3>
    <h4> first why cypher is the best agent</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Cypher's Camera it can be used to spot enemies and even fakeout/distract opponents</li>
        <li>Cypher's Cages they are short term smokes that can be entered silently for teammates but makes noise when enemies enter them so they can be spammed with bullets if entered making them useful utlity</li>
        <li>Cypher's tripwire is extremly hard to find as you have to slowly approach it and look for it and its audio cues(it only makes noise at super close distance) which gives the agent cypher or his teamates time to rotate or attack the enemy while the enemy is looking for these trips becasue if one is activated it pings the person indefintly untill the trip is broken which means the person can be seen even through walls and smokes</li>
        <li>And Finally Cypher's Ultimate ability it marks all enemy players locations with 2 pings which allows teammates to postion into both unexpected positions and to rotate to more adventatgous positons </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Things I like about cypher</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>his hat</li>
        <li>hit cool gun skin</li>
        <li>his accent</li>
        <li>the mysterious vibe about him</li>
    </ul>
